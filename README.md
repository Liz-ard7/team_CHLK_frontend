## View Notes

For writing progress points especially while we haven't linked backend actions or view transitions yet.

### CreateGroup
* useUserStore() in user.js for now just defaults to DemoUser, but once we add in user authentication, this should be modified
* The "Users to Invite" field thus far is such that the user doesn't have to invite anyone right from the get go if they choose not to
* The CreateGroup is available as a tab at the top just to be able to view it right now, but later on the view will be secured behind a button in a different view
